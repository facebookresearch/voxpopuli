# VoxPopuli

## Download the data

TODO : the raw data will be downloaded to $VOX_POPULI_DIR

## Rebuild the dataset from raw data

Here are the detailled instructions to re-process the entire dataset.

## Setup instructions

First, install the project's dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then just run:
```
python setup.py develop
```

## Unlabelled data

### Speaker diarization

To build the speaker timestamps you will need to run pyannote on the unlabelled data. To do so, launch:

```
python voxpopuli/segmentation/run_pyannote_sd.py --root $VOX_POPULI_DIR -l $LANGUAGES_LIST --segment-min 30
```

Where $LANGUAGES_LIST is the list of languages you want to deal with. For example this command will run the segmentation for french and spanish:

```
python voxpopuli/segmentation/run_pyannote_sd.py --root $VOX_POPULI_DIR -l fr es --segment-min 30
```

After launching the script go grab a coffee, it will run for some time.

## PER data

The labels and splits used in the PER experiments are the sames as the ones used in [CPC_audio](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPC_audio) and can be directlyy downloaded [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/cpc_audio/common_voices_splits.tar.gz).
